# My Second Code Review

## Alex Wallace

## Description
For this project, I was tasked with creating a function called plus_three that took an argument, added 3 to it, and returned the final value. I then called this function with two separate arguments. For the second task, I created a function called weather_report with two separate arguments. I then made a variable called "today" and created a string that inputted the two arguments in a sentence. I then called the function weather_report with two arguments to get a statement using those two arguments. Lastly, I had to create a tuple called top_ten, establish a "for" loop that multiplied each number by itself, and printed the results of the for loop. I also created an "if" condition that stated whether or not the number "7" was located in the tuple 

## Setup/Installation Requirements
In order to set this up, you will need to make a directory for your file and then switch over to that directory. Then, create a virtual environment for python 3 to work in. Finally, run an installation of the requirements.txt file using pip and change into your virtual environment using source. Voila, you're all set up to use, alter and extend this code line!

## Known Bugs
I had zero issues writing this code. After the practice I got these last two weeks, this was pretty straightforward. I did reinforce the idea that I have to save my python files before I run the code or else nothing will show up in the output. I was troubleshooting for a good while before I figured out I was missing this simple step. Other than that, I had no problems whatsoever.

SIDE NOTE: when pushing my README.md, requirements.txt, .gitignore and extra comments, I realized I hadn't created a branch to do that. the oops_i_did_it_again branch is solely to recognize this mistake and to ensure it won't happen again
